                        monks who, in the spirit of the time (religious counter-reform
                        according
                        to the

                            Trent</a>), intended to convey the

                        transience
                        of life, as the famous warning at the entrance: "We bones that are

                        for your
                        waiting." In addition to the spiritual question, there was also a
                        physical
                        question, namely; there were forty-two monastic cemeteries in the
                        Evora
                        region
                        that were taking up too much space and strategic places that many
                        intended to
                        use for other purposes. So they decided to remove the skeletons from
                        the
                        earth
                        and use them to build and decorate the chapel.
                        <br><br>
                        - The chapel, built on the site of the early brotherly dormitory, is
                        made up of
                        three naves of 18.70 m long and 11 m wide, with the light coming in
                        through
                        three small cracks on the left.
                        <br><br>
                        - Its walls and eight pillars are "decorated" with bones and skulls
                        linked by
                        brown cement. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)"
                            target="_blank">vaults</a> are of
                        white plastered brick, painted with allegorical
                        motifs to death. It is a monument of a penitential architecture of
                        ornate arches
                        with rows of skulls, cornices and white ships. It was estimated
                        around
                        five
                        thousand bones, including skulls, vertebrae, femurs and others, from
                        cemeteries,
                        located in churches and convents of the city, which were linked with
                        brown
                        cement and are arranged on the walls, ceiling, columns and even
                        outside.
                        There
                        are still two whole skeletons hanging by chains on one wall, one of
                        them
                        a
                        child.
                        <br><br>
                        - The chapel was dedicated to the Lord of the Steps, an image known
                        in
                        the city
                        as Lord Jesus of the House of Bones, which impresses with the
                        expressiveness
                        with which it represents the suffering of Christ in his walk with

                        - Alentejo Migas are one of the best known dishes of Alentejo
                        cuisine.
                        Like the
                        azordas and other dishes of this Portuguese region, the basic
                        ingredient
                        is
                        bread, a traditional Alentejo product (formerly called the "granary"
                        of
                        Portugal, due to the production of cereals which, however, has been
                        declining a
                        lot). The meat used is pork, another regional product with great
                        traditions.
                        <br><br>
                        - The bread to use should have the characteristics of traditional
                        Alentejo bread
                        - too much of the bread sold elsewhere, too fluffy and crispy, can
                        give
                        bad
                        result.
